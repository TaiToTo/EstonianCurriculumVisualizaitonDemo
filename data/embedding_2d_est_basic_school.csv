to make students read and listen to short texts from Estonian children’s literature and accomplishable 
informative, consumer and media texts in their spare time as well. In covering themes through different 
constituent skills, students are taught to understand other cultures and compare them to their own culture. 
Students are trained to use dictionaries and online sources in Estonian. 
The activities, which can be used for developing constituent skills include: 
1) listening to and reading different text types appropriate to the students’ age; 
2) independent reading of adapted texts appropriate to the students’ age; 
3) performing tasks based on what was heard and read (e.g. answering questions, filling in a table, 
making additions to drawings, etc.); 
4) sequencing tasks (e.g. making sentences from words or texts from sentences/passages);

also taken into account that the theoretical and practical parts are alternating depending on the 
students’ abilities and progress. The practice of product design facilitates acquisition of useful 
knowledge, skills and attitudes. Activities are selected depending on the development, progress 
and abilities of students; 
6) the teacher makes sure that learning is varied so that the students can study different types of work 
and topics, try processing various materials and become familiar with their properties through 
manual work and creativity; 
7) students are encouraged to express their opinions, to engage in group reflection on topics related 
to the studies, and attention is paid to provision of value education; 
8) a business-like and pleasant working environment is ensured in the classroom and student 
creativity and initiative are supported; and 
9) local opportunities are used to diversify subject studies. 
In handicraft and home economics and technology studies:  
1) learning environments, teaching materials and means are used which are based on modern 
information and communication technology; 
2) the learning environment is expanded: library, computer/multimedia classroom, the natural 
environment, companies school yard, exhibitions, museums, etc.; 
3) different contemporary methods of teaching are used, including active learning (creative thinking, 
practical and research activities, project studies, experiments, e.g., properties of different materials 
and substances, organisation of events and exhibitions, use of online environments for presenting 
and displaying one’s ideas and work, role-play, discussions, debates, etc.);  
4) the main emphasis is on a creative design process (design, testing, product improvement, etc.), 
preservation of national work traditions (national products, folk art motifs used to adorn products 
etc.) and modern technology; 
5)  safety issues are addressed before use of any new processing methods or equipment, incl. work 
instructions and demonstration of safe techniques; 
6) the time allocation of learning contents – the number and sequence of lessons – is planned while 
keeping in mind the recommendation to select two main techniques of work in handicraft, which 
can be linked to recurrent topics within the subject (design, folk art, organisation of work, and 
materials); 
7) study is organised according to a project-based format (incl. projects that connect different subjects 
and areas of life, cooperation with businesses, and cooperation between boys and girls in home 
economics, handicraft and technology studies), which facilitates greater emphasis on local 
traditions, presentation of and experimentation with various techniques, guiding students towards 
individual and collective creative problem solutions and organisation of events related to the 
subject; 
8) when preparing food in home economics or performing other practical assignments, a class is 
divided into smaller groups (1-5 students); 
9) it is kept in mind that technology study is primarily based on the product/other development cycle;

knowledge, skills, values and behaviour – with the teacher’s values and self-assertion skills creating a 
suitable learning environment and influencing students’ values and behaviour. 
Cultural and value competence. Physical education supports the promoting health and sustainable 
lifestyles. The understanding that it is necessary to protect and strengthen one’s health helps students 
make reasonable choices in their health behaviour. Respect towards nature and material values created by 
people encourages environmentally friendly practising of exercise/sports. Helpful and friendly attitude 
towards one’s fellows and following the principles of fair play in sports activities support the development of 
moral personality. 
Social and citizenship competence. Cooperation while exercising/practising sports teaches students to 
accept differences between people, to take these into account when communicating, and also to assert 
themselves. Physical education promote polite, attentive, helpful and tolerant attitude towards fellow 
students. 
Self-awareness competence. Physical education promote the ability to assess one’s physical abilities and 
readiness to improve them but also the capability to monitor and control one’s behaviour, follow a healthy 
lifestyle and prevent dangerous situations. 
Learning to learn competence. Students develop the skill to analyse and assess their level of motor skills 
and physical abilities and plan further methods to improve them.  
Communication competence. It is important to know and use specific ports and dance vocabulary, to 
develop self-expression skills, and to read/understand informative and functional texts.  
Mathematics and natural sciences and technology competence. Analysis of sports-related technical 
skills, explication of physical performance ability and the dynamics of sports results require that students 
are able to use mathematical language, relations, methods, etc., and support development of mathematical 
competence. They learn to analyse information associated with recreational sports and make evidence-
based decisions. They learn how to use technological tools.  
Entrepreneurial competence. Physical education promote the students’ ability to see problems and find 
solutions, set objectives, generate ideas and find suitable means and methods for implement them. In 
physical education studies students learn how to analyse their level of physical abilities and motor skills, 
plan further activities and act in a directed manner towards improving their health and physical ability.

44,37,"communication is a process requiring continuous effort and active involvement of learners. Learning skills 
acquired in studying foreign language A are cornerstones for acquiring other foreign languages. The 
development of learners’ command of the language is also supported by CLIL (Content and Language 
Integrated Learning).The instruction is based on the principles of communicative teaching. The emphasis is 
on interactive learning and practicing the language studied. 
Communicative language proficiency (communication competence) includes three components: linguistic, 
sociolinguistic and pragmatic. Knowledge of the language is not an aim in its own right, but a means for 
achieving better command of the language. The structure of the language is studied in context; grammar 
rules are knowledgeably learned stage-by-stage. Through sociolinguistic competence learners develop 
their ability to use the language appropriately in different situations (rules of politeness, language registers, 
etc.).Through pragmatic competence learners improve their ability to understand and create texts. 
Communication competence is developed through linguistic activities (listening, reading, speaking and 
writing). 
The backbone of language learning consists of thematic areas, which support the formation and scope of 
communication competence. In basic schools, the starting point in studying the themes is ‘Me and My 
Surroundings’. At every stage of study and in every form, themes from all thematic areas are covered, but 
to varied extent and by focusing on different things. In addressing the themes, the experiences, interests 
and needs of the students at a respective stage of study are taken into account. The language of instruction 
in language lessons is mainly the foreign language which the students are studying. If necessary, native 
language can be used for giving explanations. 
The development of learning skills, including the skill of setting learning goals and analysing personal 
results by using the European Language Portfolio or learning portfolio is equally important. Learning skills 
acquired though learning foreign language A support acquisition of subsequent foreign languages. 
Activities that require purposeful use of the language and integrate different aspects of language 
proficiency play a central role in learning foreign languages. In planning study activities, basic didactic 
principles are followed (from near to far,  from familiar to unfamiliar, from simple to complex, from concrete 
to abstract) and needs of language use are taken into account (starting from more common words and 
forms). Pair and group work are essential at all stages of study. Students are guided to work more 
independently by performing tasks appropriate to their age (read, find information, participate in projects, 
etc.). 
Students are encouraged to use the language they learn outside of language lessons in order to establish 
closer contacts with the language studied and develop their communication competence and cultural 
awareness. This can be achieved by different tasks: independent reading, seeking information from 
different sources or projects where students work together under the teacher’s supervision and use all 
constituent skills. To motivate students, it is advisable to help them find pen-friends, organise field trips and 
student exchanges, and to invite native speakers of the language they study to language lessons. 
It is essential to motivate learners at every stage of study and develop their positive attitudes towards 
language learning. In order to experience a sense of achievement, a positive atmosphere is created in the 
classroom and all accomplishments of learners are recognised. Efforts made to achieve the results are 
acknowledged as well. Mistakes are considered normal elements in language learning; their analysis 
facilitates understanding and enables the students to correct their language use.

73,6,"The subject of religious studies is based on the recognition of the principle of freedom of religion and 
thought as stipulated in the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Religious education is 
one of the preconditions for ensuring freedom of religion in society. 

These religious studies do not advertise any particular church, congregation or other religious association. 
The optional course of religious studies is not meant to influence the students to accept a particular world 
view as the norm. The task of the optional course at the basic school level is not to guide the students 
towards acceptance of any particular religion. The goal is to prepare the students for life in a pluralistic 
society and in a world where they will come into contact with people of different religions and world views. 
That is why the stress in these religious studies is on shaping skills and attitudes that form the basis for 
mutual understanding, respect, openness and readiness for dialogue and cooperation. 
The process of learning about different religions and world views must rely on a balanced scientific 
approach. The students who attend lessons of religious studies will gradually understand the diversity of 
religions in the past as well as in contemporary world with its positive and negative manifestations. Religion 
in all societies has always been one of the forces shaping people’s lives and culture, and a source of 
inspiration for writers, artists and musicians. Religious education facilitates understanding of global cultural 
heritage. 
The students’ empathy and mutual respect are encouraged by examining various ways of comprehending 
the world around us. Religious studies must be organised and conducted so as to take into account and 
respect the convictions that the students are exposed to at home. An important component of religious 
studies is the support of the students’ moral development through the fostering of responsible and ethical 
life skills. Learning about different religions and world views develops critical thinking, creates opportunities 
for tackling existential issues and supports each student in shaping their own world view. 
The subject of religious studies enriches the outlook of the students as they become familiarised with 
various ways of comprehending the world we live in. 
The teaching materials used in religious studies are connected with the previous knowledge and 
experience of the students. It is important to become familiarised with the religion related cultural values of 
the home area, and to create connections with the problems and questions posed by the students. It is 
recommended to involve the students in the process of compilation of the religious studies work schedule.

technological development and changes in the human role in the work process helps students realise the 
need for life-long learning. Selection of technological options to implement their own ideas, work planning 
and both individual and collective work help the students develop and analyse their working abilities, 
interests and cooperation skills. Study activities facilitate direct contacts with the world of employment (e.g., 
study visits to enterprises): students learn about occupations, professions, jobs and further education 
opportunities associated with the subject field. Study activities provide students with an understanding that 
different jobs can have different requirements and working conditions and guide students to analyse 
whether their health status and physiological attributes are suitable for the jobs they are interested in. It is 
explained to students, why it is important to follow occupational safety regulations and how medical 
conditions can restrict the ability to work in certain fields. 
Environment and sustainable development. Information environment. It is important to use both 
natural and artificial materials thriftily when making a product. Attention is given to shaping and 
encouraging the shaping of environmentally friendly consumer habits. Sorting of waste and economy of 
energy and resources during lessons facilitate reinforcement of ecological knowledge. 
Citizens’ initiative and entrepreneurship. Initiative, enterprise and cooperation are closely connected 
with the content of technology subjects. Implementation of the students’ own ideas and the skill of work 
organisation are among the primary goals of the subject in this field. Enterprise is supported by capably 
completed projects that allow the students to test their abilities.",technology,0.8769303,1.4514189

128,90,"For the majority of the students, whose native language is not Estonian, ‘Estonian as a second language’ is 
their first contact with the language and culture of another nation. Therefore, it is very important to provoke 
their interest in Estonian language and culture and increase their motivation to learn other foreign 
languages.In addition to studying Estonian, learners’ command of the language is also developed through 
CLIL. 
Acquiring a foreign language as a means of communication is a process requiring continuous effort and 
active involvement of learners. The instruction is based on the principles of communicative teaching. The 
emphasis is on interactive learning and practicing the language studied. 
Communicative proficiency of the language (communication competence) includes three components: 
linguistic, sociolinguistic and pragmatic. Knowledge of the language (pronunciations, grammar and 
vocabulary) is not an aim in its own right, but a means for achieving better command of the language. The 
structure of the language is studied in context; grammar rules are knowledgeably learned stage-by-stage. 
Through sociolinguistic competence learners develop their ability to use the language appropriately in 
different situations (rules of politeness, language registers, etc.). Through pragmatic competence learners 
improve their ability to understand and create texts. Communication competence is developed through 
linguistic activities (listening, reading, speaking and writing). 
The backbone of language learning consists of thematic areas, which support the formation and the scope 
of communication competence. In basic schools, the starting point in studying the themes is ‘Me and My 
Surroundings’. At all stages of study and in every form, themes from all thematic areas are covered, but to 
varied extent and by focusing on different things. In addressing the themes, the experiences, interests and 
needs of the students at a respective stage of study are taken into account. In language lessons, students 
and teachers mainly communicate in Estonian. Explanations may be given in the school’s language of 
instruction if necessary. In the course of studies, students’ learning skills are developed, including the skill 
of setting personal learning goals and analysing the results by using for instance the European Language 
Portfolio or a learning portfolio.  
In planning study activities, basic didactic principles are followed (from near to far, from familiar to 
unfamiliar, from simple to complex, from concrete to abstract) and the needs of language use are taken into 
account (starting from more common words and forms). Pair and group work (role plays, acting, 
brainstorming) are essential at all stages of study. Students are increasingly guided to perform independent 
tasks appropriate to their age (read, find information, participate in projects). 
The content learned is integrated with use of the language outside of language classes. This can be done 
through varied activities, which take place in the language environment (student exchange, joint activities of 
several schools, field trips, seeking information in varied information sources). Language studies are 
complemented through learners’ personal experiences, which they can share with their fellow students. 
It is essential to motivate learners at all stages of study and to foster positive attitudes towards language 
learning. In order to experience a sense of achievement, a positive atmosphere is created in the classroom 
and all accomplishments of learners are acknowledged. Efforts made to achieve the results are 
acknowledged as well. Mistakes are considered normal in the language learning process; their analysis 
facilitates understanding and enables the students to correct their language use.

to guide emotional and critical reception of literary works and educate cultured readers who are capable of 
recognising true works of art.   
The subject prioritises examination of Russian literature, including folklore, and literature that is associated 
with the ethnic origin and cultural community of students. students who understand different cultures – who 
are tolerant towards and respect other national cultures – requires love and respect for their own national 
culture and understanding its place in the cultural heritage of the world. Discussion of works by Estonian 
and foreign authors supports an understanding of the links and mutual influences between the literature of 
different nations, as well as adoption of generally accepted human values.   
The main criterion for selecting literary works is their artistic value, humanist goals, positive influence on 
students’ personality and the relevance of the problems posed in the work to the moral education of 
students and to developing tolerance. In selecting literary works for reading and classroom examination, it 
is important to consider both the psychological and intellectual abilities as well as the interests of the

190,12,"The field of arts enables natural integration of all general competences in daily studies, both theoretically 
and practically. The teacher plays a crucial role in shaping the four interconnected components of 
competences – knowledge, skills, values and attitudes – with the teacher’s values and self-assertion skills 
creating a suitable learning environment and influencing students’ values and behaviour. Cooperation 
between school and home is important for the development of general competences. 
Cultural and value competence. The subjects  of field of arts stress the importance of cultural knowledge 
and the cultural space based on common cultural heritage as part of our identity. Individual and cultural 
diversity are valued in activities. The topics reviewed, and the works of art and art events analysed support 

the formation of ethical and aesthetic value judgements. Practical creative activities and discussions on 
them teach the students to regard arts and music as a means of self-expression, appreciate different ideas, 
viewpoints and problem solutions and respect authorship. Knowledgeable and critical attitudes to all 
information sources are fostered. 
Social and citizenship competence. Investigative assignments, practical group works, creative works, 
discussions, presentations, joint music making and collaborative art projects, and participation in field-
specific and inter-field study projects are the components of the art subjects that develop students’ 
readiness for cooperation and high regard for mutual support. Participation in cultural events facilitates the 
formation of a feeling of cultural togetherness. By discussing works of art the students practise defending 
their points of view and learn to respect the opinions of others. The art subjects acknowledge the role of the 
human being as a maker and a user of the environment, and direct the students to act with awareness and 
sustainability both in nature and in real and virtual man-made environments. 
Self-awareness competence. Regular feedback and development of self-analysis skills self-analysis help 
the students recognize their own interests and abilities and achieve positive self-esteem. Treatment of 
cultural and social topics (cultural phenomena observed, subject matter and messages of works of art and 
pieces of music, etc.) facilitates the formation of the students’ personal, social and cultural identities.  
Learning to learn competence. The development of learning to learn competence of the students is 
supported through art subjects by applying various assignments, study methods and forms of work, 
allowing the students to recognize and utilize their own style of learning. Individual and collaborative 
investigative and problem-based assignments require collection of information, its analysis and 
interpretation and application of previously acquired knowledge in novel situations. In art subjects the 
students can themselves create feasible assignments, check the suitability of their choices, try new skills 
and practise consistently. Regular feedback and self-analysis help increase the students’ ability of 
managing their own studies. 
Communication competence. An important part of art subjects is talking about works of art, 
corresponding styles, eras, etc, using both correct language and subject-specific terminology in the 
description. The students’ presentations of work and comparison and defence of different viewpoints in 
discussions serve to support the development of the skill of self-expression and the use of subject-specific 
terminology. Writing of reviews and creative works in art and music subjects requires an understanding of 
information-source texts and stimulates the use of various methods of presenting information (text, 
drawings, schemes, tables and charts). The art subjects introduce art and music as a means of 
communication – the students learn the corresponding non-verbal language and how to ‘translate’ artistic 
messages into the verbal variety and vice versa. 
Mathematics and natural sciences and technology competence. Completion of assignments in art 
subjects requires formulation of problems, reflection on solution ideas, justification of options and analysis 
of results. Students learn to use art concepts (composition, structure, rhythm, etc.), compare and classify 
the attributes of different art phenomena and use symbols. Art terminology includes vocabulary elements 
and concepts of mathematics and technology. By completing creative assignments, students learn how to 
use technological tools and innovative solutions, understand the role of science and technology in the 
development of music and art.  
Entrepreneurial competence. The development of enterprising skills via art subjects is supported by 
individual and group work, investigative and problem-based assignments and connecting the knowledge 
acquired with contemporary phenomena from daily life Practical creative activities offer opportunities to 
experiment with different ways of expressing and presenting one’s ideas as the students inventively select 

suitable methods and make use of their personal strengths. The students learn to plan their work and

Physics is a natural science and plays an important part in shaping the students’ literacy in science- and 
technology-related issues. Physics explains natural phenomena, creates corresponding models and is 
closely connected to mathematics. Physics forms a basis for understanding instruments and technology 
and helps students to value technological professions. 
The Physics Learning in basic school only studies a small proportion of physical phenomena and forms a 
basis from which to later develop a complete picture of physics as a natural science. In studying physics, 
1
the students obtain a preliminary overview of the language of physics and learn to use it. The things studied 
are associated with everyday life, mathematical skills, instruments and technology and other natural 
sciences. 
In studying physics, the main focus is on integrating natural sciensesscience (Physics, Chemistry, Biology 
and Geography) from two directions. Vertically, these subjects are integrated through common topics, such 
as development (evolution), interaction, movement (changing and transformation), systems and structures, 
energy, technology and the environment (society). Vertical integration is supported by the specificity of the 
area, taking into account the horizontal integration of the subjects. 
The values of students are shaped by associating the solutions to problems with the general 
cultural/historic context. At the same time, the role of physicists in the history of science is studied as well 
as the meaning of physics and its applications for the development of humankind. 
In the studying process the students develop skills that are needed for successful studies (of physics). 
Solving calculus-, graphics- or problem-based tasks and assessing how realistic the results are creates a 
basis for critical thinking. When learning about phenomena, experiments are preferred; when solving 
problems, scientific method are used. 
The material studied is presented in a problem-based way as much as possible and in connection with the 
students’ everyday lives. In the studies, the individual specificities of the students are taken into account 
and their abilities are developed from diverse perspectives. Significant attention is paid to shaping the 
studying motivation of students, and in order to achieve this various interactive study methods are used: 
problem-based and research-based studying, project work, discussions, brainstorming, role plays, study 
outside of the classroom, study visits etc. When planning studies, the teacher may change the order of the 
topics studied, wherein it is important to note that the changed order of topics follows the developmental 
specificities of the students and that the teaching takes place according to the principle of the growth of 
abstraction. When changing the order of themes, the students’ motivation to study physics must be 
guaranteed (and this should, hopefully, see them achieve better results). At all stages of study, 
technological instruments and information and communication technology are used. 
With research-based study the students learn how to formulate problems and hypotheses, plan work, carry 
out observations, measure and process, interpret and present results. An important role is played by oral 
and written presentation of research results, including verbal and visual forms of presentation. An important 
role is also played by the skill of using different sources of information (including the Internet) and critically 
assessing the information found there.",natural_science,5.2723246,8.485802

8th or 9th grade. 
The subject is addressed in conjunction with daily life. The subject can be taught as a practical activity 
through participation in the operation of the mini company.  Two thirds of the course load of the optional 
subject is aimed at practical activities and the solution of tasks which develop creativity and critical thinking 
skills. Practical work concerns a specific individual topic or material. Independent activities include 
homework, class work and computer work.  
Priority is given to active teaching methods like discussions, case analyses, role plays, projects and 
educational visits, visits to local companies, meetings with entrepreneurs and enterprising parents, and 
volunteer work in the local community. 
Entrepreneurship provides an overview of the functioning of companies and the importance of 
entrepreneurship in the society. Entrepreneurship studies help better understand the interconnections 
between human activity and the environment, and the scarcity of resources. Entrepreneurship studies 
convey to the students the concept that both individuals and companies are responsible for ensuring the 
sustainable development of the society. Entrepreneurship studies endeavour to make the students 
understand that the decisions related to developing personal entrepreneurial skills and promoting 
business operations must duly take into account the need to sustain the natural and living environment.  
The students receive information on the requirements related to various professions, learn the roles of 
employee and entrepreneur (employer), learn to assess their skills, intentions, and development needs 
and possibilities, prepare a curriculum vitae and assess the roles of employee and entrepreneur 
(employer). 
The students are taught to value entrepreneurship and the environment, and acquire problem solving and 
research skills, management and teamwork skills, financial writing skills and digital competencies. The 
teaching focuses strongly on developing the motivation to learn by relating the education to daily life and 
local business.  
Entrepreneurship studies are closely linked to other subjects, relying on knowledge in mathematics, 
geography and history, and supporting the acquisition of civics and citizenship education, personal, social 
and health education, career education, and supporting career choice. In planning entrepreneurship 
studies it is reasonable to plan and coordinate the provision of course content in consultation with the 
teachers for civics and citizenship education, geography, personal, social and health education, 
handicraft, home economics and technology education. For addressing discussion topics it is reasonable 
to envisage cooperation with the teacher for language and literature. 
To develop the students’ skills of using knowledge and technology, the teachers employ modern 
technological means, incl. ICT facilities (web sites of companies, local and central government authorities, 
legislation available on-line, the Company Registration Portal, interactive business games, value-based 
games, etc.).

313,33,"Cross curricular topics are considered in the subjects of the field when establishing objectives, planning 
learning outcomes and contents, based on the study stage and the specific nature of the particular subject.  
Lifelong learning and career planning. Role plays, discussion of texts, debates and creative assignments 
contribute to the development of students’ communication and cooperation skills, which are important in 
future employment. Education develops the ability to form personal opinions, to express oneself in a clear 
and adequate manner in both oral and written communication, to solve problems. Study activities enable 
students to acquire the vocabulary required for self-assessment in order to analyse their interests, abilities, 
skills and knowledge in a particular subject and in other areas, and students are guided to use the results of 
the self-assessment for drafting plans for further education and employment. Study activities also facilitate 
direct contacts with the world of employment (e.g., study visits to enterprises, presentation of professions 
associated with the subject field). Students enhance their skill to prepare necessary documents for 
continuing their studies and applying for work. The analysis of media texts guides students to an 
awareness of social processes and to a reflection on their impact on further education and employment. 
Environment and sustainable development. Health and safety. Reading of relevant texts, solution of 
problem assignments and presentation of oral and written arguments supports students’ development into 
socially active, environmentally conscious, responsible individuals who value health and safety.   
Civic initiative and entrepreneurship. Discussion of texts of different types guides students to notice 
social problems and to try and find solutions for them. Participation in projects promotes an active mindset 
towards life. 
Cultural identity. Language and literature as carriers of national culture support the development of 
students’ self-concept, knowledge of their roots and of special forms of Estonian language (e.g., Mulgi, 
Võru, Seto, Kihnu dialects). Valuation of native language and literature teachers respect for oneself and 

one’s ethnic nationality, while reading of texts of other nations helps to form an understanding of the 
difference of cultures as well as recognition of humanity’s shared cultural heritage. 
Information environment. Obtaining information from different sources (incl. the Internet) and critical 
assessment and use of the information are prerequisites for expanding the knowledge of language and 
study subject and for creating texts. 
Technology and innovation. The opportunities of the information society are consciously used for solving 
study problems; students are guided to look for alternative solutions and to implement their ideas.  
Values and morality. The reading and discussion of fiction and cultural information texts and the creation 
of new texts based on them is guided by the need to develop students as moral individuals who are familiar 
with and respect generally accepted human and social values. The analysis of texts contributes to the 
development of courage to speak up against objectionable acts and attitudes.",language_and_literature,15.812332,7.4580045

339,252,"The subject syllabus of literature presumes an understanding of the problems in the literary works 
examined, forming own attitudes towards them, participating in discussions on the material read, taking into 
account the opinions of others and well-grounded argumentation of own opinions. As a literary work, like 
any piece of art, has multiple levels, it is possible to look at every literary text through the prism of different 
problems and this in turn enables students to return to problems covered previously. 
The study of literary works in basic school is based on the principles of creativity, communicativeness and 
stadiality. The principle of creativity requires an activity-based approach to literature, with the main 
emphasis on the all-around development of students’ creative potential. Within the communicative 
approach, learning is seen as a dialogue-like process in which the students are fully licensed actors. The 
artistic reception of literary works is also understood as a communicative activity. The principle of stadiality 
in examining literary works presumes the application of didactic tasks at every stage of learning that are in 
line with the students’ aesthetic needs and their level of creative abilities. The theoretical aspect of literature 
studies is kept to a minimum, because it is more important to create and maintain an interest in reading and 
develop interpretation skills than to impart factual knowledge.  
In the course of studying literature, students acquire the necessary historical and literary knowledge, come 
to understand the meaning of literary terms and learn to use of them. The reading list is compiled to ensure 
reasonable proportions of Russian, Estonian and world literature, older and newer literature and different 
genres of prose, drama and poetry. The teacher can use the recommended selection of complete works to 
prepare a specific list, based on the interests, the learning style and abilities of particular class. The teacher 
selects at least four complete works to be examined in each form.  
The specific areas of study activities include text reading, paraphrasing, interpreting and analysing, 
development of figurative thinking and expressive language use and creative activities (creative writing and 
public presentations). 
Literature studies are connected with almost every subject but primarily with areas related to Russian 
language and literature (history, folklore, theatre, film and the fine arts) and support with their learning 
contents the examination of cross-curricular topics and attainment of key competences. The nature, depth 
and emphasis in discussing cross-curricular topics can be different depending on the class, being largely 
dependent on the particular selection of literary works. The aim is to enable students to adopt their own 
positions with regard to the topics covered, based on the fictional texts they have read.

394,11,"Social studies subjects address the way in which individuals and society functioned in the past and how they 
function today. Through social studies subjects, students develop their ability to see causal and other 
connections in the development of society; to make informed choices by espousing values and moral norms 
valid in society.  Studies shape the students’ willingness to act as moral and responsible individuals and 
members of society. 
In History lessons, students acquire knowledge of the history and cultural heritage of their home area and the 
world necessary for an understanding of their cultural space. Through the subject, students are guided to 
understand, analyse, critically judge and interpret historical events and processes as well as their mutual 
relations and links with the present day and to see why historical events are interpreted in different ways. 
Teaching History contributes to integrating the content of other subjects into a whole and shapes the ability to 
understand developments which have been influenced by past events. 
Personal, social and health education integrates the learning content at all stages of study by supporting 
students in managing social life among their contemporaries, within their family, community and society and by 
helping them to become socially mature and legally capable individuals. The general aim of Personal, social 
and health education is to contribute to the development of students’ coping skills in social life. This aim is 
realized by nurturing students as developed personalities and by fostering their social competence, health 
awareness and integrity, regard for others, responsibility and fairness. Personal, social and health education 
helps to acquire basic knowledge and attitudes regarding gender equality. 
In Civics and citizenship education, students master social literacy: the knowledge, skills, values and 
attitudes necessary for fully functioning in society and for making responsible decisions. The general aim of the 
subject is to create the preconditions for stronger cohesion between individual identity as a citizen and society 
and for creating active citizens. 
All subjects in the social studies subjects field support the development of students’ ability to analyse their 
behaviour and its consequences, to express their feelings appropriately, to accept that people are different and 
take this into account in communication; to assert themselves and to oppose injustice in a way that does not 
harm their own or other people’s interests or needs. Through the subjects within the social studies subject 
field, students become familiar with social values, norms and rules and learn to follow them; and they acquire 
knowledge, skills and attitudes appropriate to socially acceptable behaviour and relationships between people 
which help them effectively adjust and function among their contemporaries, in their family, community and 
society. Social studies subjects provide the basis for accepting ideological diversity and for willingness to have 
a dialogue with supporters of different worldviews. Cooperation skills and group work are essential in the 
context of every subject within the field.",social_studies,12.599721,-1.6684035

Language and literature, including foreign languages. Education develops the skill of clear and relevant 
oral and written self-expression, ability to read and understand various texts. Students are guided to use 
appropriate linguistic means, subject-specific vocabulary and expressive language while observing correct 
grammar. Education emphasises the skill of critical text analysis, media literacy, acquisition and critical 
assessment of information, formatting of projects, and protection of intellectual property. The learning of social 
subjects improves students’ knowledge of different cultures and traditions. Students are guided to notice and 
respect the differences between their own and other cultures. Attention is paid to the rules of different 
communication environments and social diversity. Concepts of foreign-language origin are explained and 
foreign language skills are also developed through searching and understanding additional material.  
Mathematics. The following skills are developed: chronology; planning resources (time and money), 
mathematical literacy, presenting and reading numerical data (graphs, tables and diagrams); the ability to pose

environments (for instance, assess the accuracy of media-published diagrams based on what they have 
learned) and gain an overview of the current taxation system. Logical reasoning and factual thinking enable 
people to make right decisions in life. Practical assignments, group work tasks and participation in projects 
improve cooperation, mutual support and respect for each other. 
Art subjects. Art and geometry (technical drawing, measurement) are closely interconnected. The 
development of art competence can be supported with resources that demonstrate geometry applications 
in art fields, such as architecture, interior design, ornamental art, design, etc. Geometric concepts can be 
used as a basis for analysing objects in art education. Classification of important characteristics of shapes 
and use of symbols are integral elements of art together with comparison and classification of properties of 
depicted objects/phenomena. As a result of integration, students will develop the ability to see the beauty of 
graphs drawn in computer software, to notice the beauty of different geometrical shapes in their home 
environment and in the nature, to calculate the area and volume of familiar shapes if necessary. 
In music, intervals, measures and note durations are usually expressed as common fractions. 
Technology. The classes of handicraft and home economics, crafts and technology studies involve 
practical measurements and calculations, reading and creation of drawings, etc., in connection with 
designing and creating projects. 
Physical education. The skill to interpret numerical data is expressed in the ability to compare sports 
results and understand the information presented in ranking tables. Text problems are used to explain the 
importance of healthy lifestyle, physical activity and sports for human health, as well as the importance 
medical achievements. Students can use objective numerical data to assess their health behaviour, for 
instance, the quantity of sugar in food, traffic behaviour (speed, braking distance, visibility), etc. Physical 
activity and movement contribute to understanding the basic concepts of units and measurement systems. 
One type of mathematical models of reality, namely maps, are used in physical education classes to learn 
navigation. Consistency, accuracy and the ability to identify the simplest and best solution are integral parts 
of both mathematics and sports.

and diligence on the basis of written and/or practical tasks and activities, taking into account the 
compliance of students’ knowledge and skills to the objectives and learning outcomes of the syllabus. 
Evaluation of the learning outcomes proceeds from the approach of the general part of the national

1) apply theoretical knowledge in practical learning situations; 
2) demonstrate the skills defined in the learning outcomes in learning situations; and 
3) describe how the knowledge and skills defined in the learning outcomes are used in everyday life. 
Assessment in personal, social and health education means supporting achievement of learning outcomes 
and students’ development, with the main emphasis being on supporting students’ development, which should 
include opportunities for self-assessment. In addition to subject-specific knowledge and skills, formative 
feedback is also provided in values and attitudes. Assessment of values and attitudes is facilitated by role 
plays, case studies and group work.  
The objective of testing and assessing learning outcomes in history is to receive an overview of the level of 
attainment of learning outcomes in history studies and individual development of students, and to use this 
information for more productive planning of studies. A balance of knowledge (historical vocabulary) and skills 
should be observed when testing learning outcomes. 
The forms of checking and assessing learning outcomes should be diverse and include spoken and written 
answers, working with maps, reference sources and pictures as well as creative tasks and writing a story. 
Tasks that require an analysis of important historical events and phenomena should be preferred to knowing 
specific facts. Short stories and descriptions are assessed based on their logical composition and coherence 
and the appropriateness of terms and keywords to the context, style, grammar and spelling.  As in Form 5 the 
tests should not check the knowledge of more than one studied theme at a time. 
The forms of checking and assessing learning outcomes in the 3rd stage of study should be diverse and 
include spoken and written answers, working with maps, documents, reference sources and pictures, 
compiling reviews and research papers as well as creative tasks and writing discursive essays. In the case of 
analysing reference sources, students’ skills in finding essential information and in judging and comparing it, 
answering based on a text fragment; commenting and deciding on its reliability are assessed. Tasks that 
require analysis of important historical events and phenomena should be preferred to knowing specific facts. In 
the case of discursive essays, students are assessed based on the relevance of their train of thought to the 
theme, their familiarity with the relevant period and facts, their abilities to compare and find links and to 
express their personal position through well-founded judgements. At the third stage of study, both open and 
multiple choice questions can be used to check and assess students’ knowledge. 
In civics and citizenship education, creation of assignments for developing and testing reasoning skills in 
the 2nd study level, from keywords to supportive explanations and exact instructions, should be in keeping with 
the principle of aptitude-appropriateness. Summarising grading can be used for opinion essays and case 
studies, document and map knowledge, assignments with open-ended and multiple choice answers, matching 
concepts and definitions, translation of information to a different format (from graph to table, etc.), and finding, 
using and grouping information.  
Summative assessment in the 3rd stage of study can be based on discussing problems, opinion pieces, 
research papers and case studies, analysing documents, statistics and caricatures, reading maps, open and 
multiple choice tasks: linking terms to their explanations, translating information to another form (for example, 
from a diagram to a table), and grouping information. 
In the case of practical work, assessment focuses on the skills of planning and performing the work, 
interpreting its results and drawing conclusions as well as explaining and presenting the results. 
Students and teacher cooperate to assess learning outcomes also in informal education outside school if the 
respective attainment (e.g., participation in projects, work in student bodies or civic associations) conforms to 
required learning outcomes.",social_studies,8.785291,-1.8190972
476,23,"The main purpose of assessment is to support students’ development in shaping a positive self-concept and 
an adequate self-assessment. The subject syllabus describes learning outcomes of a subject by study stages 
at two levels: general learning outcomes as objectives of education and learning outcomes associated with 
partial skills. Students’ knowledge and skills are assessed on the basis of oral response, incl. presentations, 
and written projects, taking into account the conformity of knowledge and skills with the required learning 
outcomes specified in subject syllabi as well as students’ individual traits and thought development. 
Assessment is based on corresponding provisions of the general part of the basic school curriculum. 
Feedback is provided on attitudes and values (e.g., showing interest, understanding importance, valuing, 
consideration of needs, following rules). 
Learning outcomes are assessed with verbal assessments and numerical grades. Diverse forms of 
assessment should be used for measuring learning outcomes. Students have to be informed about what and 
when is going to be assessed, which assessment tools and criteria will be used. Formative assessment has an 
important role with its primary focus on comparing a student’s development with his or her previous 
accomplishments. Assessment criteria and any assessment procedures that deviate from the standard five-
grade system are specified in the school curriculum. 
The assessment of written assignments focuses first and foremost on their content. Students’ grammar and 
spelling mistakes are also corrected, although they are not taken into account in grading. The main emphasis 
when assessing subject-specific knowledge and skills and attitudes is on formative assessment.  
Diverse forms of assessment, including oral, written and practical assignments corresponding to required 
learning outcomes are used for assessment.  
Selection of assessment methods is made in consideration of students’ age-specific differences, individual 
abilities and preparedness to handle specific activities. The process is assessed in addition to the result in 
case of practical assignments.  
In spoken and written assignments, students: 
1) explain and describe the meaning of concepts and the relations between them; 
2) explain their viewpoints, assessments, positions and attitudes by relating them to the knowledge they 
have acquired;",social_studies,8.780235,-1.7727677

Art subjects can be associated with all cross-curricular topics. Cross-curricular topics are considered when 
establishing objectives, planning learning outcomes and contents for the subject of the field, based on the 
study stage and the specific nature of the particular subject. 
Lifelong learning and career planning. Education develops independent learning and acting skills as a 
crucial foundation of lifelong learning habits and attitudes. Different forms of study are used to develop 
students’ communication and cooperation skills, which are important for future employment. Art and music 
enable students to acknowledge their abilities and interests, to acquire subject-specific and general thinking 
and acting strategies. Students examine the diverse expressions of arts in daily life, the professions and 
occupations related to arts, and can have direct experiences with the world of employment, e.g., by visiting 
creative undertakings. Students learn about occupations and further education opportunities associated 
with the subject field. 
Environment and sustainable development. Information environment. These topics cover a wide 
range of skills, such as finding information on music and art, audible and visual means of communication, 
visual and audio design of the environment. Students examine databases, the opportunities and risks of the 
media environment, and copyright issues. They learn to acknowledge the surrounding natural or artificial 
environment as a source of creativity and acquire environmental protection skills. Education places a high 
value on cultural heritage and sustainable development of natural culture. It emphasises the skill to identify 
recycling opportunities and to analyse the objects of an artificial environment from ecological, aesthetical 
and ethical perspectives. 
Citizens’ initiative and entrepreneurship.Art subjects encourage students to form and express their 
opinions concerning social processes and to test and implement their ideas.  
Technology and innovation. Art subjects utilise different skills and tools in practical creative assignment, 
providing opportunities to invent and test new possibilities, supporting the development of individuals who 
can successfully navigate the constantly changing technological living, learning and working environment.  
Health and safety. Art subjects raise awareness of the emotionally balancing effect of art practice. The 
practice of fine arts is associated with the use of materials, tools and instruments that require adherence to 
the principles of safety and expediency.   
Values and morality. Values and morality. The learning contents and study activities present local, 
Estonian and global cultural heritage, raise awareness of the role of culture in everyday life, and support 
development of heritage culture in the modern globalising world. Education contributes to the formation of 
an open and respectful attitude towards different cultural traditions and modern cultural phenomena. It 
places value on creative expressions of new ideas, personal experiences and emotions. Students are 
guided to participate in art events that help to form shared values (exhibitions, museums, concerts and 
performances). It is important for young people to participate/perform in song festivals, musical and art 
events.",art,-0.9600593,-2.3586664
480,15,"sustainable attitude towards their surroundings and taught to value the physical and social environment. 
Outdoor lessons are possible. Pupils learn to take personal responsibility for a sustainable future and 
achieve appropriate values and behaviour models. The perspectives of environmental and human 
development are assessed based on facts. When handling this particular topic, descriptive mathematics 
related to percentage calculation, elements of statistics and change and relation. 
Citizens’ initiative and entrepreneurship. Preparation for cooperation and tolerance towards other 
people’s actions and opinions are developed through cooperative activities (research, group work, projects) 
that integrate mathematics and other subjects. The percentage calculation and elements of statistics 
enable the pupils to understand the meaning of numerical data used to describe society and its 
development. 
Cultural identity. Mathematics is a part of both global and national culture. A modern living environment 
could not exist without mathematics. This can be emphasised by presenting the history of mathematics, the 
connections between the development of society and mathematical research, etc. By means of percentage 
calculation and statistics, pupils are able to describe the processes occurring in society in relation to the 
topic of the multicultural world (different nations, different religions, different social positions in society etc.). 
Information environment. The information environment is associated with the skill to present and 
understand information in different formats (drawing, image, formula, model). An adequate perception of 
media manipulations is supported by the problems presented in the mathematics course, making use of 
statistical procedures and percentage calculations. Students are guided towards critical analysis of 
information.  
Technology and innovation. Technological processes and modelling are presented through integration of 
the mathematics course with technology and natural science subjects. When planning and implementing 
their activities and assessing the final results, students perform measurements and calculations and use 
ICT tools for studying and increasing the efficiency of their work. Various educational software applications 
can be used in mathematics education. 
Technology and innovation. By solving problems students learn how to use technological tools and 
understand the importance of mathematics for scientific and technological development.   
Health and safety. Mathematics education can include problems containing health and safety data (e.g., 
text problems related to the traffic environment, movement of road users and vehicles; other problems and 
graphs presenting data on risk factors). 
Values and morality. Study of mathematics is accomplishable if students develop their systematic 
approach, consistency, persistence, accuracy, correctness and sense of responsibility. The example of the 
teacher facilitates development of a tolerant attitude towards other students with different abilities. Studying 
and teaching mathematics should offer students as many positive emotions as possible. 
.7. Planning and Organizing Study Activities

networks and official information systems (e-school, e-learning environment and school and local 
government websites); 
9) the topics studied should be interconnected based on cooperation between the subject teachers 
and timed to match civic studies, foreign languages and studies of the native language. In the 
middle of the course the students begin working in smaller groups or pairs on a development 
project, connecting the topics of further studies with this project;

703,15,"The following interrelated components are distinguished in the competences – knowledge, skills, value 
judgements and conduct. In teaching these four components, teachers play a central role, as their value 
judgements and assertive abilities create an appropriate learning environment and influence the value 
judgments and conduct of their students. 
The learning objectives and learning outcomes of the foreign languages instructions comprise language 
competence, cross-cultural competence (value judgements, conduct) and learning skills. 
By teaching foreign languages, all general competences (value competence, social competence, self-
management competence, learning to learn competence, communication competence, mathematics 
competence and entrepreneurship competence) are developed by following the set aims and themes to be 
examined and by implementing different teaching methods and study activities. 
Cultural and value competence is supported by becoming   familiar with the cultures of countries where 
different languages are spoken. Students learn to understand and accept different value systems based on 
cultural specifics. 
Social and citizenship competence. In order to cope in different every-day communication situations, it is 
essential to know and use appropriate linguistic forms; it is also vital to know the cultural background, rules 
of conduct and social practices of the countries where the foreign language, being studied, is spoken. Thus, 
social and citizenship competence is closely related to value competence. The formation of social and 
citizenship competence is facilitated by using different forms of study (e.g. group work, project-based 
teaching) and active participation in cultural programmes related to the language learned. 
Self-awareness competence is developed through the themes studied in foreign language. Issues related 
to human relations and oneself can be approached in foreign language lessons through discussions, role 
plays and other activities that help students better understand themselves. Assessing personal strengths 
and weaknesses is closely related to the development of learning to learn competence. 
Learning to learn competence is consistently formed by implementing different learning strategies (e.g. 
seeking information from sources in foreign languages, using dictionaries). Self-reflection and analysing 
acquired knowledge and skills (e.g. according to the European Language Portfolio) are also important. 
Communication competence is the central competence in teaching foreign languages. The objectives of 
foreign language teaching proceed directly from the components of communication competence and their 
content. Good self-expression skills and ability to understand and create texts are prerequisites of 
successful communication in foreign languages. Together with communication competences, students 
develop the skill to compare the similarities and differences between their own and foreign cultures and to

812,20,"The teaching of subjects and assessment of competences in the field of arts is based on the actual 
development of individual students and achievement of learning outcomes. Assessment is conducted in 
accordance with the provisions of the general part of the national curriculum for basic schools and the 
learning outcomes specified in the national curriculum for basic schools. Assessment criteria and any 
assessment procedures that deviate from the five-grade system are specified in the school curriculum. 
The objective of assessment in art subjects is to support students development, encourage students to find 
original ideas and creative solutions and direct them towards purposeful learning; to guide the development 
of students’ self esteem, to arouse interest in music, art and culture, and to lay a foundation for a lifelong 
practice of music and art; to guide and support students in choosing an education path in the field of arts. 
Assessment provides feedback on students’ individual development and constitutes the basis for the 
planning of subsequent studies. 
Assessment is based on the required competences of the subject field, focusing on the following: 
1) development of students’ musical and artistic abilities; 
2) application of knowledge and skills in musical performances and artistic creations; 
3) original approach to creative assignments. 
Assessment values students’ theoretical knowledge, diligence and participation in the study process, and 
efforts to implement the results. It is important in assessment to recognise the diversity of solutions and 
individuality of students. 
The forms of assessing the learning outcomes should be diverse, they should motivate students’ 
development and correspond to their learning outcomes. Learning outcomes are assessed with numerical 
grades and oral assessments. Numerical grades are supplemented by oral feedback. Students have to be 

informed about what and when is going to be assessed and which assessment criteria will be used in case 
of both oral assessments and numerical grades. The teacher’s verbal assessments and numerical grades 
should motivate students’ development in the field of arts. 
Both formative assessment and summarising grading are used in assessment, depending on the 
established learning objective and the contents and goals of the curriculum. 
When assessing written assignments, teachers primarily take into account the content but also correct 
spelling mistakes. 
In arts education, assessment of students is based on the following outcomes, specified for different study 
levels: 
Assessment at 1st study stage: 
1) skill to use art concepts and knowledge of art and culture objects in the local environment; 
2) skill to use different methods and techniques in creative assignments, with efficient use of materials 
and safe handling of tools; 
3) creative, original and sustainable performance in individual or group assignments; 
4) skill to appreciate and analyse one’s own artistic creations and those of the peers and to reflect on

subject. 
Health and safety. Acquiring the knowledge, understanding, skills and experiences necessary for healthy 
lifestyle is supported both in lessons and through extracurricular activities, and also through creating a 
physical and social learning environment. 
Lifelong learning and career planning. The students are encouraged to be healthy and take care of 
increasing their physical ability in the changing learning, physical and social environment and work 
environment in physical education studies. Students develop an understanding of how physical health 
affects their future employment. Learning activities enable students to become familiar with the world of 
employment associated with health and physical education. In case of special skills and interest in a 
specific sport and/or form of exercise, students are guided to practise the field in a more profound manner. 
Students learn about occupations, professions, jobs and further education opportunities associated with the 
subject field. 
Environment and sustainable development. Practicing sports in nature facilitates appreciation of the 
environment and development of environmentally-conscious exercise habits. 
Citizens’ initiative and entrepreneurship. The students are encouraged to organise extracurricular 
exercising activities (sports and dance events and competitions of one’s own initiative, exercising and 
training groups guided by students etc.). 
Cultural identity. Physical education lessons are used to learn more about sports / forms of exercise that 
are part of the exercising culture of students’ own nation and that of other countries and they help students 

to become culturally conscious members of society who appreciate their culture and cultural diversity. In 
order to develop cultural identity, it is important to appreciate the tradition of Estonian dance festivals and to 
participate in dance festivals.  
Information environment and Technology and innovation. Different sources of information, incl. the 
Internet, are used in physical education to find sports-related information.   
Values and morality. Students follow the ultimate ideal of sports – fair play principles – in their physical 
education and extra-curricular sporting activities. Understanding and following the rules applied to sporting 
activities support the development of students as moral individuals.",physical_education,3.458864,2.1339374

822,13,"1.4. Options of Forming General Competencies 
The study of subjects in the field of social studies contributes to the development of all general competences 
described in the national curriculum. The teacher plays a crucial role in shaping the four interconnected 
components of competences – knowledge, skills, values and behaviour – with the teacher’s values, 
communication and social skills creating a suitable learning environment and influencing students’ values and 
behaviour. 
Cultural and value competence. The development of cultural and value competence is supported by all 
subjects within the subject field by emphasizing different aspects. For instance, the ability to understand the 
basic values of humanitarianism, democracy and sustainable development of society and to base one’s 
actions upon these values is supported through History and Civics and citizenship education. All social 
subjects facilitate respect for different beliefs in understanding the world. Personal, social and health education 
and Religious studies support the understanding of value systems, the capacity to live in harmony with one’s 
ideas, words and feelings, having reasons for personal choices and having regard for the welfare of others. 
Skill to stand against violations of central norms and to follow the principles of social justice and equal 
treatment of different genders is one of the general objectives of the curriculum, and it is developed primarily 
through civics and citizenship education and personal, social and health education.  
Self-awareness competence that is the ability to understand and assess oneself, to analyse one’s strengths 
and weaknesses and develop a positive attitude towards oneself and others; to lead a healthy way of life and 
effectively and safely; to solve problems related to one’s mental, physical and social health or personal 
relationships. The development of competence is supported by Personal, social and health education, but also 
by other subjects within the field, which shape ethnic, cultural and national self-management. 
Learning to learn competence. Each subject within the social studies subject field develops the ability to 
organize the learning environment and acquire tools and information necessary for studying. Each subject also 
teaches  students how to plan studies and use the knowledge acquired in different contexts and in solving 
problems. Through study activities and receiving feedback, students acquire skills of self-analysis and are able 
to plan their further studies accordingly. 
Communication competence. All subjects address the ability to express oneself clearly and appropriately in 
different situations, to read and understand informative and consumer texts as well as fiction, to write different 
types of texts by using appropriate linguistic tools and styles and to value correct grammar and expressive 
language. 
Mathematics and natural sciences and technology competence. Each subject within the social studies 
subject field develops the ability to use mathematics with its unique language, symbols and methods to solve 
different tasks in all spheres of life and activity, is supported by all subjects within the field. Students learn to 
distinguish social studies from natural sciences (incl. understand the differences between their research 
methods). They learn to search for information using technological tools and to make evidence based 
decisions using collected information. 
Entrepreneurial competence. Competence in entrepreneurship is first and foremost shaped through Civics 
and citizenship education, but also to a lesser extent by other subjects within the field. Students learn to 
observe problems and to see the opportunities they offer, to set goals and to generate and implement ideas. 
Subject studies develop the ability to take initiative and responsibility, to cooperate in order to accomplish their 
goals, to complete what they have started, to respond to changes in a flexible way, to take reasonable risks",social_studies,8.772223,0.96543634

The aim of assessment with regard to the subjects of the technology field is to support students’ 
development, motivate purposeful learning, guide the development of students’ self-esteem, create and 
increase a lifelong interest in handicrafts and technology, guide and support students in the choice of their 
future education path. Assessment supports development of students’ technology competence, 
technological literacy and provides feedback on students’ individual development, constituting the basis for 
the planning of subsequent studies. 
Assessment is regulated according to the respective provisions of the national curriculum for basic schools 
and both formative assessment and summarising grading are used, depending on the established learning 
objective and the contents and goals of the curriculum. Important in student assessment are the verbal 
appraisal provided by the teacher, the numerical grade and the student’s self-assessment. In the subjects 
of the technology field, assessment also takes into account students’ participation in subject olympiads, 
contests, competitions and other such events. In the 9th Form, a final paper can be used for summarising 
grading of students’ knowledge and skills. 
In technology studies, assessment covers students’ work culture, technological literacy and the ability to 
design and manufacture a product: 
1) attitude towards learning, diligence, studiousness, persistence, attentiveness; 
2) cooperation skills, helpfulness, independence in the performance of work; 
3) compliance with the rules of conduct in study premises; 
4) planning (originality, independence, possibility for idea/design implementation expediency) the 
choice of materials and means, product-making method, technical correctness of the working 
drawings etc.; 
5) the skill of making and substantiating choices (idea, processing method, material etc.) and 
describing connections; 
6) production process (cooperation skill, working independently, the skill of using materials, means, 
written and information technology resources, theoretical knowledge and skill in its application, 
adherence to occupational safety requirements etc.); and 
7) work results (implementation of the idea, product finishing, aesthetic value, timely completion of 
work, product quality etc.), including performance of separate tasks and skills in product 
presentation.

spelling mistakes, which are not taken into account in assessment.",technology,0.9707133,1.3782849

discussions, projects, etc.). The attained general competences are reflected in text creation, presentations 
and deliberations. The teacher plays a crucial role in shaping the four interconnected components of 
competences – knowledge, skills, values and behaviour – with the teacher’s values and self-assertion skills

notice and solve problems, assess and develop abilities and guide their own learning. 
Communication competence. Joint tasks and projects allow the students to learn how to take other 
people into account, help them when necessary and experience the advantages of collective work. Solving 
of research problems and creation of presentations contributes to the development of the skill to read and 
understand informative and functional texts and to write different types of text. 
Mathematics and natural sciences and technology competence. Specific problem solution methods 
used in technology subjects require calculation and measurement skills, the skill to use logic and 
mathematical symbols. Education includes activities that facilitate development of reasoning abilities, 
requiring formulation of problems, identification of suitable solutions strategies, justification of choices, and 
analysis of results. Students learn how to use, create and critically assess various technologies and 
technological tools. They learn to understand the role of science in technological development and vice

During lessons, students and teachers communicate mainly in Estonian. Teachers encourage students to 
actively use Estonian also in the language environment (e.g. lessons in museums, field trips, student 
exchanges). Students take part in Estonian cultural life more than before (e.g. group visits to theatre 
performances, concerts and museums). 
Teachers guide students to read shorter abridged and authentic works of fiction as well as informative, 
consumer and media texts appropriate to their age. Different forms of shorter and longer creative works are 
used for developing students’ writing skills. 
Students begin to approach language studies analytically; they learn to see the similarities and differences 
between languages and notice mistakes that they or other people make in using the language. 
Students learn to understand cultural differences, recognise them and take them into account. Teachers 
encourage students to take an interest in Estonian culture and society and participate in it. Students learn 
to value diverse ways of thinking, express their opinions and consider different views. 
The activities, which can be used for developing constituent skills include, e.g.:

set out in the general part of the national curriculum for basic schools and other documents governing 
such assessment. 
The purpose of assessment is to obtain an overview of the learning outcomes attained and individual 
student development and using the information obtained to plan more effective studies.  Assessment 
includes the students’ knowledge, their skills in implementing this knowledge, creativity in solving tasks, 
and their acquisition of general competences, including learning skills. Assessment is based on oral 
answers (presentations), written and practical work and independent activities, taking into account how 
the knowledge and skills of the students comply with the learning outcomes stipulated in the curriculum.  
Formative assessment is prioritised as it develops the skills of reasoning, justification and establishing 
connections, the students' independent work, participation in group work and discussions, due regard to 
the formatting requirements of written work, and overall correctness. 
Participation in group work and mini companies can be assessed during the learning process. The 
learning outcomes are assessed using oral appraisal and numerical grades. The students must know 
what is being assessed and when, what means are being used for assessment and what are the 
assessment criteria. 
The overall grade is derived from grades for tests, practical work and research papers, independent work, 
and reports presented. 
Depending on the selected teaching method, the school can choose between conducting a final 
examination, preparing a learning portfolio, or drawing up a management report of the mini company

learn to understand themselves and the role of arts in society. 
Through the creation, presentation, interpretation and analysis of works of art the students learn about 
traditional and contemporary arts and their content, form and meaning, and comprehension and critical 
approaches are developed. Education develops flexible thinking and an open mind towards cultural and 
individual differences that support the ability to navigate the rapidly changing and multicultural world. 
Practical involvement in arts develops emotional sphere and intuitive and creative thinking. Art serves as an 
important hobby that enriches our daily lives and helps us attain emotional balance. Art activities 
counterbalance the predominantly verbal and analytical thinking fostered by other subjects, adding a 
figurative, synthesising and intuitive side to the thought process. This results in integral thinking that 
facilitates creative approaches to problems, acknowledge different solutions and multi-faceted outcomes.

3) differentiated learning tasks are given and their content and levels of difficulty support an individual 
approach and enhance motivation to learn; 
4) the contents of studies in other subjects are taken into account when compiling a school syllabus 
and the teacher’s work schedule, and integration with other subjects is used if possible. For this 
reason, general education principles are applied in craft study. Technology studies are closely 
integrated with mathematics and nature subjects. The topics of home economics provide 
opportunities for integration with civics and citizenship education, personal, social and health 
education, biology and chemistry, while health-conscious behaviour skills can be practiced through

primary constituent skills, field-specific and general competencies. 
At the 2nd stage of study the students are divided into study groups based on their wishes and interests, 
selecting either handicraft and home economics or technology studies. The division into study groups is not 
gender-based and the school curriculum can include provisions for teaching the subjects of the technology 
field in combined classes at the 2nd and 3rd stages of study to contribute to the promotion of gender equality 
and to provide both boys and girls with necessary knowledge and skills in technology studies, handicraft 
and home economics. 
The students switch between the study groups for at least 10% of the duration of these studies so that 
technology studies is replaced by home economics, and handicraft and home economics by technology 
studies. 
Technology studies contributes to the development of five constituent skills: technology in our daily lives, 
design and drawing, materials and their processing, home economics, and project work. The first three 
constituents comprise approximately 65% of the total duration; home economics 10%; and project work 
25%. 
Handicraft and home economics contributes to the development of four constituent skills: handicraft; 
home economics; technology studies (when the study groups are switched) and project work. Handicraft 
and home economics comprises approximately 65% of the subject, and at least one third of this is home 
economics. Approximately 25% of the subject volume is dedicated to project work and 10% to technology 
studies.

994,9,"As part of the subject field, physical education supports students in developing a health-conscious lifestyle, 
creates a basis for students’ independent exercising routine, facilitates interest in sports and dance events, 
encourages students to follow competitions and events and to participate in them. Physical education 
supports development of students’ physical/motor abilities, as well as moral, social and aesthetic 
development and growth as wholesome persons. 
In physical education lessons students are guided to monitor their physical fitness level and to improve it 
through regular training and acquiring new (including independently acquired) knowledge and skills. 
Exercising and practising sports in an environmentally friendly manner, being respectful towards fellow 
students and valuing cooperation and the principles of fair play support students’ social and moral 
development. 
Physical education proceeds from the need to support the development of students to become healthy 
individuals with good physical abilities. The knowledge, skills and experiences acquired in physical 
education lessons encourage students’ diverse development and enable them to find a suitable, safe and 
healthy exercising routine. 
Basic school physical syllabus includes gymnastics, athletics (the learning outcomes and content of the 1st 
stage of study including running, jumps and throws as the main forms of exercise), exercises and team 
sports (basketball, volleyball and football – the school is obliged to teach two of these), dancing activities, 
winter sports (skiing and skating – the school is obliged to teach one of these) and orienteering as primary 
areas. Students complete a basic swimming course at the 1st or 2nd stage of study. Knowledge about sport 
and exercising/practising sports is introduced through practical activities and/or guiding students towards 
independent (extracurricular) learning. 
When organising physical education, the schools have to take into account the interests of students, sports 
or exercise traditions of the school and/or locality and existing sporting facilities. For this purpose, it is 
envisaged that the learning outcomes specified in the subject syllabus of physical education are achieved 
within 75-80% of the prescribed number of lessons.  
Schools are allowed to use 20-25% of the prescribed physical education lessons to teach sports and forms 
of exercise not included in the syllabus (handball, hockey, baseball, badminton, different dance styles etc), 
to reinforce the skills of the main fields of area included in the syllabus or to teach these in a more profound 
manner. 
Dancing activities performed in physical education lessons may be integrated with other sports and forms 
of exercise. It is important to be familiar with popular Estonian folk dances and dance elements, which 
connect students with the tradition of folk dance festivals.

folk art and study of materials are connected with both the compulsory subjects and various elective topics 
and projects. Several subjects can be combined when making an item during practical work. 
2nd stage of study primarily emphasises the acquisition of the main work methods and technologies and 
the development of the skill of working in accordance with a manual or using auxiliary materials. Practical 
work is performed every year, facilitating creative application of the technological methods learned. 
3rd stage of study is focused more on creative work and informed work organisation. The subject is taught 
in compliance with the product development cycle of a handicraft item: from information-gathering, idea 
development, design, work scheduling and technological planning to actual performance and presentation 
of the results. 
The students in home economics classes acquire the skills and knowledge to cope with daily life tasks. In 
addition to practical cooking classes, the students learn the basics of healthy eating and how to create 
balanced diets. The students develop their housekeeping skills, assess consumers who act in an

1027,25,"The subjects within the foreign languages field represent learning objectives and themes at different stages 
of study. These support students’ initiative and active thinking and the acquisition of cross-curricular topics 
through the use of appropriate source (authentic) texts in foreign languages and by applying working 
methods that develop different competences. 
Cross-curricular topics are first and foremost related to the following thematic areas: 
1) Lifelong learning and career planning: ‘Learning and Working’. Education develops independent 
learning skills as a crucial foundation of lifelong learning habits and attitudes. Different forms of 
study are used to develop students’ communication and cooperation skills, which are also 
important for future employment. Foreign language education provides students with the necessary 
vocabulary for self-analysis and self-presentation to be able to introduce themselves in a foreign 
language and to communicate their thoughts in a comprehensible manner. Education offers 
opportunities for direct contacts with the world of employment, e.g., through visits to undertakings, 
presentations of occupations, professions and further education opportunities related to the subject 
field. This contributes to the students’ skill to prepare necessary documents for continuing their 
studies and applying for work. 
2) Environment and sustainable development: ‘Estonia – My Home’. The aim is students’ 
development into socially active, responsible and environmentally conscious individuals who 
preserve and protect the environment and, valuing sustainability, are prepared to seek answers to 
issues related to environmental and human development. 
3) Citizens’ initiative and entrepreneurship: ‘Me and others ’, ‘Daily Life. Learning and Working’, 
‘Estonia – My Home’, ‘Spare Time’. The aim is students’ development into active and responsible 
members of community and society who understand the functioning principles and mechanisms of 
society and the importance of civic initiative, feel that they are members of society and rely in their 
activities on the country’s cultural traditions and development directions. 
4) Cultural identity: ‘Estonia – My Home’, ‘Countries and Their Culture’. The aim is students’ 
development into culturally conscious individuals who understand the importance of culture in 
shaping human thinking and behaviour and the change of cultures throughout history, who have an 
understanding of the diversity of cultures and the specific features of practical life determined by 
culture, and who value their own culture and cultural diversity, are tolerant and willing to cooperate. 
5) Information environment: ‘Daily Life. Learning and Working’, ‘Countries and Their Cultures’, ‘Spare 
Time’. The aim is students’ development into information-conscious individuals who can sense and 
acknowledge the information environment, are capable of critical analysis of this environment and 
of action that corresponds to their objectives and socially accepted communication ethics. 
6 
) Technology and innovation: ‘Daily Life. Learning and Working’, ‘Spare Time’ The aim is students’ 
development into individuals who can accept innovations and use modern technology for its 
intended purpose, who are able to navigate rapidly changing technological living, learning and work 
environments. 
7) Health and safety: ‘Me and others ’, ‘My Home and Surroundings’, ‘Daily Life. Learning and 
Working’. The aim is students’ development into mentally, emotionally, socially and physically 
healthy members of society who observe a healthy lifestyle, behave in a safe manner and 
contribute to the development of a health-promoting and safe environment. 
8) Values and morality: Me and others , ‘My Home and Surroundings’, ‘Estonia – My Home’, ‘Daily 
Life. Learning and Working’, ‘Countries and Their Cultures’, ‘Spare Time’. The aim is students’ 
development into morally mature individuals who are familiar with generally accepted social values 
and moral principles, who follow them inside and outside of school, who are not indifferent if those 
principles are being disregarded, and intervene within the limits of their powers whenever 
necessary.",foreign_languages,10.927697,-0.5734306

1029,75,"Formation and development of constituent skills is interconnected with the development of students’ 
creative and independent thinking as well as with acquisition and reinforcement of new knowledge through 
practical creative activities. Skill formation is a consistent process and the students associate their 
experience with knowledge of the contemporary world: connections between history of art and the art of 
today, development trends of environment design and visual culture.  
It is important to discover and create connections with the eras and topics studied in other subjects. Art is 
treated both as an independent system of values and the key to reasoning, understanding and perceiving 
the life around us. 
Field trips to museums and art galleries provide the basis for understanding both art history and 
contemporary art. Examples are selected from art history in accordance with more general topics and 
provision of a chronological overview is not pursued. The stress is on creating a bridge between past and 
present-day phenomena. All topics are illustrated with as many examples as possible from art and visual

1035,29,"1.6. Options for Implementing Cross Curricular Topics 
Studying natural science subjects is related to all cross curricular topics described in the general part of the 
national curriculum. The cross curricular topics are taken into consideration when planning the objectives, 
learning outcomes and study content of the subjects in the subject field based on the stage of study and the 
specifics of the subject. 
Environment and sustainable development. Natural science subjects have a central role in 
implementing this cross curricular topic. 
Lifelong learning and career planning. Skills of independent learning are developed which is an 
important basis for acquiring the habits and attitudes of lifelong learning. Different study forms are used to 
develop the communication and cooperation skills of the students, which they require in their future working 
life. Learning natural science subjects increases the pupils' awareness of career options and gives them 
information about the options of continuing studies in fields related to natural sciences, the field of nature 
and environmental protection. Learning activities enable to have direct contact with the working world, e.g. 
getting acquainted with companies. 
Citizens’ initiative and entrepreneurship. Sensing civil rights and obligations is related to environmental 
issues

1039,105,"Education provides a general foundation and basic knowledge that the students must acquire to perform 
the required tasks or make certain products. During the lessons the teacher integrates the course content 
with practical activities (wood- and metalwork, electronics etc.). The course content and/or sequence can 
be altered by stage or the knowledge and skills already acquired can be tackled in more depth at the next 
stage. The teacher plans and arranges these parts during the school year in cooperation with the teacher of 
handicraft and home economics. In the interest of subject diversity, the study groups of handicraft and 
home economics and of technology studies are switched. 
Education emphasises students’ sensible and creative innovation where the joy of discovery is coupled with 
an experience of producing something from idea to finished product. The students perform interesting and 
imaginative practical tasks, including task or product planning, design and production, self-assessment and 
presentation of results.  
Practical output and connections are revealed between school subjects and life spheres, fostering an 
integral understanding in the students of the corresponding task or product. It is important for students to 
understand how technology functions and personally participate in creation of technology that is suited to 
students, incl. a functioning item.  These objectives are achieved in compliance with the contemporary 
development level of the students and in a manner that is understandable to them. Different abilities and 
interests are also taken into account, and self-initiative and learning motivation are supported. The subject 
is taught stressing the importance of inventive activities and the young people’s work-related behavioural 
attitudes and value judgements are shaped. The students are encouraged to value environmentally friendly 
approaches and local traditions and acquire ethical convictions.",technology,0.7723507,1.4885908
1040,15,"Interdisciplinarity is a trait inherent of contemporary culture. Art subjects are closely connected to all fields 
of human activity and the manners of thought of corresponding eras. Art subjects encompass such topics 
as being human, social relations and our world in its various manifestations. It is therefore natural that art 
subjects have ties with other subject fields and there are lots of possibilities of creating connections 
between art subjects and other subject fields. 
Different cultures are presented in many subjects of other fields (language and literature, foreign 
languages, history, civics and citizenship education, geography, handicraft and technology, physical 
education), supporting the development of values and awareness of cultural diversity of the world. 
Compared to other subjects, art subjects have a more specific focus on elaborating on intercultural 
dialogue and using creativity as a source of innovation in modern society. 
Several subject fields – language and literature, mathematics, technology, physical education – use 
concepts that overlap with the concepts of art subjects (e.g., composition, structure, dimensions, angles, 
geometric shapes, rhythm, plan, style, variation, improvisation, movement, dynamics, etc.).  
Subjects of the art field rely on knowledge acquired in other subjects, while deepening and visualising this 
knowledge. Practical activities contribute to the development of the understanding that knowledge and 
competences are mutually connected and applicable in everyday life. Study projects that cross the 
boundaries of subject fields facilitate integration of art subjects with other subject fields and development of 
competences. 
Language and literature, including foreign languages. Education develops oral and written self-
expression skills, articulation, functional reading skills and the skill to use information channels, and 
examines the stories of different eras and cultures in music and art, theatre and film.  
Math. Education develops associative skills and logical thinking (mathematical language, structure, 
symbols and methods), as well as knowledge of mathematical symbols, shapes and concepts.  
Natural sciences. Education creates awareness of the physiological characteristics of human senses of 
hearing and sight, provides information on the natural environment and the diversity of its organisms, as 
well as the properties of sound, light and colours.  
Social subjects. Students examine relations with other human beings and groups of people, as well as 
with customs and traditions of different cultures, the roles and changes of art and culture in different 
historical periods.  
Technology. Education develops manual skills and creative thinking, the ability of innovative generation 
and practical implementation of ideas (creative process, technologies and techniques).

Language proficiency is key to understanding and appreciating national culture. Good Russian proficiency 
is the precondition of successful learning of all subjects in a Russian-language school. The subjects of the 
subject field primarily support the development of competences in native language and literature and 
enhancement of communication skills among basic school students. These subjects provide knowledge of 
language and literature and offer various experiences of reading, writing and communicating. The subjects 
of the subject field also support formation of students’ identity and self-esteem, as well cultural and social 
development.  
From Forms 1 to 4, Russian is a subject that develops four constituent linguistic skills (speaking, listening, 
reading, writing) and orthography through the reading of informative, functional and literary texts, reflection 
and writing, and establishes preliminary knowledge of phonetics, orthoepy, orthography, lexicology, 
phraseology, morphemics and grammar. The study of Russian is mainly practical at the first stage of study. 
Students acquire basic knowledge of language and literature, learn how to speak, read and write correctly 
and to listen in a focused manner; education also develops students’ attention and interest in reading. 
From Form 5, Russian language and literature are two different subjects, which are linked by a text-centric 
approach and development of constituent linguistic skills. The study of literature is aimed primarily at the 
enhancement of students’ interest in literature and reading ability as well as ethical and emotional 
development through the reading and interpretation of literary works, but it also deals with the specifics of 
literary language and develops students’ oral and written self-expression skills.  
The second study stage expands students knowledge of phonetics, orthoepy, lexicology, phraseology, 
morphemics, morphology and syntax, and develops orthographic and punctuation skills. Text analysis 
requires examination of the structure of text, formulation of the main idea, determination of speech type and 
style, identification of figurative expressions and connections used in the text. The study of orthography is 
based on texts. 
Students develop an informed attitude towards speech, either their own or others’, and a skill to 
communicate in an adequate manner in different situations. In reading and writing, the emphasis is on 
comprehending the texts of others and creating own texts. Listening comprehension is important. Attention 
is also paid to developing the skill to use neutral and expressive linguistic means. 
The study of phonetics, orthoepy, morphology and orthography concludes at the third stage of study 
(Forms 7–9) and this stage includes systematic work with syntax and punctuation. Students acquire basic 
knowledge of text as a linguistic and speech unit, the particular features of text structure, creation and 
comprehension of texts, and associations between different types of text. All rhetoric skills are refined with 
the aim to attain communicative competence in basic areas of speech actions. The main emphasis is on 
the development of various speech forms in particular situations and the skill to use resources of all 
linguistic levels for self-expression depending on situation. Students learn to comprehend, analyse and 
create various texts. 
Correct and coherent speaking and diverse vocabulary are developed throughout basic school. The degree 
of independence in working with texts is gradually increased: text comprehension, interpretation, creation of 
texts in different genres and styles.  
The subject teacher selects the contents of education in consideration of achievability of the learning 
outcomes, general and subject field competences specified for that study stage.

1080,67,"Learning foreign language B as a second foreign language enables students to broaden their 
communication opportunities and cultural horizons, ensures access to knowledge sources and creates 
preconditions for direct communication, and supports their further studies and activities in society. It is 
important that different languages are taught constructively and  that they support each other, especially in 
terms of seeing links with foreign language A. The learning experience and skills acquired in studying 
foreign language A support studying foreign language B. The knowledge which students acquire on the 
culture and country of the language they learn through other subjects is also taken into account. 
Acquiring a foreign language as a subject and as a means of communication is a process, which requires 
continuous effort and active involvement of learners. In language lessons, students and teachers mainly 
communicate in the foreign language that the students study. If necessary, native language can be used for 
giving explanations. Instruction is based on the principles of communicative teaching. The emphasis is on 
interactive learning and practicing the language studied. 
Communicative proficiency of the language (communication competence) includes three components: 
linguistic, sociolinguistic and pragmatic. Knowledge of the language is not an aim in its own right, but a 
means for achieving better command of the language. The structure of the language is studied in  context; 
grammar rules are knowledgeably learned stage-by-stage. Through sociolinguistic competence learners 
develop their ability to use the language appropriately in different situations (rules of politeness, language 
registers, etc.). Through pragmatic competence learners improve their ability to understand and create 
texts. Communication competence is developed through linguistic activities (listening, reading, speaking 
and writing). 
The backbone of language learning consists of thematic areas, which are instrumental in developing 
communication competence and its scope. At both stages of study and in every form, themes from all 
thematic areas are covered, but to varied extent and by focusing on different aspects. In addressing the 
themes, the experiences, interests and needs of students are taken into account. Activities that require 
purposeful use of the language and integrate different aspects of language proficiency play a central role in 
learning foreign languages. In planning study activities, basic didactic principles are followed (from near to 
far, from familiar to unfamiliar, from simple to complex, from concrete to abstract) and the needs of 
language use are taken into account (starting from more common words and forms). Pair and group work 
are essential at both stages of study. Students are guided to perform independent tasks appropriate to their 
age (read, find information, participate in projects, etc.). 
In order to develop students’ communication competence and cultural awareness, they are encouraged to 
use the language outside of language lessons as well. To increase their motivation, it is advisable to help 
them find pen-friends, organise field trips and student exchanges as well as meetings with native speakers 
of the language they study. 
It is essential to motivate learners at both stages of study and develop their positive attitudes towards 
language learning. In order to experience the sense of achievement, a positive atmosphere is created in 
the classroom and all accomplishments of learners are recognised. Efforts made to achieve the results 
need to be acknowledged as well. Mistakes are considered normal in language learning process; their 
analysis facilitates understanding and enables the students to correct their language use.",foreign_languages,8.821721,-2.6885803

1197,136,"2.3.2. Subject description 
Geography is an integrated subject which belongs to both the natural science (Natural Geography) and 
social sciences (Human Geography). The students rely on the knowledge, skills and attitudes acquired in 
Science, and integrate Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, History and Civic Studies. In studying 
Geography, the students develop scientific and technology literacy, the students acquire an understanding 
of the Earth as a whole and the mutual effects between the environment and human activities. An important 
role is played by skills of solving problems and making justified decisions. The knowledge, skills and 
attitudes acquired in Geography and other natural and social sciences form the basis for internally 
motivated lifelong learning. 
The main aim of basic school Geography is for students to gain an overview of the phenomena and 
processes taking place in nature and society and their spatial distribution and connections by studying 
certain areas as examples. The emphasis is on the importance of preserving natural and cultural diversity 
and the need to research this. The students acquire an understanding of science as a process which 
1
creates knowledge and provides explanations about their surroundings. At the same time, the students’ 
inquiry and problem-solving skills are developed. 
In studying Geography, it is important to develop an understanding of the connections between humans 
and the environment, the limited nature of natural resources and the need to use them rationally. The 
students’ environmental awareness is developed: they adopt a sustainable lifestyle and gain an idea of 
sustainable development, plus attitudes that value the environment, which is looked at in its widest 
meaning, including the natural, economic, social and cultural environment. 
Geography plays an important role in shaping the students’ values and attitudes. Approaches to world 
nature, population and cultural geography form a basis for an understanding and tolerant attitude towards 
the cultures and traditions of other countries and peoples. Studying Estonian Geography forms a basis for 
valuing the nature, history and cultural heritage of the students’ homeland. 
In order to cope in the fierce competition of a globalising world, people need to know different areas of the 
world – their economies, cultures and traditions – better, primarily for studying, working and recreation. 
Studying Geography helps to shape the self-definition of students as active citizens of Estonia, Europe and 
the world. 
In studying Geography, the students acquire skills in map-reading and use information technology, the 
need for which is growing in today’s mobile society. 
The material studied is presented in a problem-based way as much as possible and in connection with the 
students’ everyday lives and home areas. In the studies, the individual specificities of the students are 
taken into account and their abilities are developed from diverse perspectives. Significant attention is paid 
to shaping the studying motivation of students, and in order to achieve this various interactive study 
methods are used: problem-based and research-based studying, project work, discussions, brainstorming, 
role plays, studies outside of the classroom, study visits etc. At all stages of study, technological 
instruments and information and communication technology are used. 
With research-based study the students learn how to formulate problems and hypotheses, plan work, carry 
out observations, measure and process, interpret and present results. An important role is played by the 
skill of using different sources of information (including the Internet) and critically assessing the information 
they find there.",natural_science,5.252149,8.453606

1201,46,"1st Stage of Study focuses on singing and playing musical instruments. Singing in unison is practised both a 
cappella and with accompaniment. In this age group the school builds the foundation for the preservation 
and propagation of musical traditions and one of the outputs here is participation of all students in the 
school choir in order to acquire the basic choral singing experience. The students acquire the initial 
techniques of playing different rhythm instruments (including body percussion) and xylophones, as well as 
the 6-string smaller zither or the  recorder. Musical instruments are predominantly played to accompany 
singing. Musical movement is significant: folk dances and singing games and expression of the characters 
of a particular piece of music through movement. Musical thinking and creativity are developed through 
accompaniment, rhythmic and melodic improvisation and text creation, including the  composing. By 
listening to music the students learn to understand its characters and moods and to depict the pieces of 
music they have listened to.  
The foundations of musical literacy are acquired through musical activities and they are then applied to 
various musical activities. The performance skills of the students are developed both during the lessons of 
music and beyond them and outside of the school (choirs, soloists, different groups of players of musical 
instruments, etc.).

In order to offer the students a diverse musical listening experience, shape their concert attendance culture 
and expand their horizons the students are offered opportunities to attend concerts and theatrical plays

competences. 
Cultural and value competence. Mathematics is a science that unifies different cultures. Thus, pupils can 
learn about the works of mathematicians from different countries and eras. Pupils are guided to recognise 
the elegance of logical trains of thought as well as the beauty of geometric objects under observation and 
their relation with architecture and nature. Studying mathematics helps to develop such character traits as 
determination, persistence, perseverance, accuracy and attentiveness while also teaching to follow 
discipline. Solving of mathematical problems creates interest in the surrounding world and improves 
understanding of the laws of nature. Pupils will learn to notice the connection of mathematics to daily life 
and understand that basic mathematical knowledge improves comprehension of other science disciplines. 
Social and citizenship competence. Responsibility towards society and fellow citizens is raised by 
solving tasks with relevant content. Paired and group work tasks enable students to develop their 
cooperation and mutual assistance skills and to increase tolerance towards students with different 
mathematical abilities. 
Self-management competence. In mathematics independent work has an important role to play. By 
means of independent task solving, pupils can assess and develop their mathematical abilities. 
Learning to learn competence. When studying mathematics, it is essential to perceive the learning 
material in depth and understand everything. Solving problem tasks develops analytical, rational method 
finding and critical outcome assessment skills. Generalisation and analogy-using skills are very important: 
skills in carrying acquired knowledge over to suitable contexts. Pupils are guided towards the 
understanding that complex tasks can only be solved by using independent thought.

1237,12,"Mathematics is integrated with other subject fields in two principal ways. Through the use of mathematical 
methods in other subject fields, students develop an understanding of mathematics as a basic science, with 
its universal language and methods, that supports other subject fields. The use of problems associated with 
other subject fields and real life provides students with an idea of application opportunities of mathematics.  
Language and literature, including foreign languages. Education develops the skill of clear and relevant 
oral and written self-expression, creation, interpretation and presentation of texts, including tables, graphs, 
etc. Students are guided to use appropriate linguistic resources and mathematical vocabulary while 
observing correct grammar. The solving of text problems helps to develop functional reading skills, 
including the ability to understand visual information. Attention is paid to the correct writing of numerals, as 
well as accurate formatting of text, graphs, tables and other information. The meaning of mathematical 
concepts of foreign origin is explained and foreign language skills can be developed through the search 
and use of additional resources. 
Natural sciences. A mathematics teacher can engage in close cooperation with teachers of natural 
sciences. The productivity of such cooperation depends, on the one hand, on the mathematics teacher’s 
knowledge of the content of other subject fields and, on the other hand, on the abilities and skills of science 
teachers to use mathematics and its language in a reasonable and accurate manner in their subject field. 
Inquiry learning in science subjects requires students to have the ability to analyse the data collected 
through observations and experiments, and to present the results of observations and experiments as 
graphs, diagrams and tables.  
Social subjects. The solving of problems helps to develop the skill of understanding and selecting 
information: to differentiate between important and unimportant parts and to identify (in a text, on a drawing, 
etc.) data required for solving a problem. The formatting of solutions to problems and formulation of 
hypotheses and theorems helps to develop the skill of clear, concise and accurate expression of thoughts. 
Information on mathematical concepts can be combined with the provision of information on important 
social topics, such as population structure and the shares of different social groups, individual and state 
budget, wages and taxes, interest, interest on arrears, the risks associated with rapid loans, the use of pro 
mille and percentage point units in daily life, etc. Data from the social sphere is used in the context of

1263,12,"The study of foreign languages in the subject field is based on the Common European Framework of 
Reference for Languages and the language proficiency levels set out therein. The learning outcomes of all 
foreign languages (including Estonian as a second language) have been described on a uniform basis as 
set out in the Framework. Learning outcomes in different constituent skills have been presented at the end 
of the subject field syllabus in Clause 2.4, in the table explaining the levels of language proficiency. 
The implementation of the principles of the Framework and the European Language Portfolio in the study 
process motivates students to learn foreign languages by taking into account learners’ age-specific and 
individual characteristics and guides students of differing abilities to set achievable personal learning goals, 
and gives  them objective feedback on their performance. All this facilitates enduring learning motivation 
and the formation of independent learners. 
Present-day language instruction is directed towards communication needs and focuses on learners and 
their communication objectives. The most essential thing in language studies is the skill of using the 
language and not merely being familiar with the structure of the language. Learners will develop correct use 
of the language through long term practice. 
Communication competence is formed through developing the four constituent skills of language 
proficiency – listening, reading, speaking and writing –, and therefore the learning outcomes have also 
been presented according to constituent skills. These constituent skills are taught integrally. 
Language studies enhance thinking, develop clear self-expression skills, create texts and understand them. 
In these areas, teaching a foreign language is supported by teaching the native language and vice versa. 
Basic school students develop the skill to compare the similarities and differences between their own and 
other cultures, to understand and value the uniqueness of other cultures and languages, to be tolerant and 
refrain from developing biased attitudes towards everything that is foreign. Being familiar with other cultures 
helps students to perceive the specifics of native culture and language more knowledgeably. 
Foreign language instruction calls for open and flexible teaching methods, which enable the instruction to 
be adjusted according to learners’ needs. 
The essential principles in learner-centred teaching of foreign languages are: 
3 
) learners’ active participation in the study process, their knowledgeable and creative use of foreign 
languages and formation of learning strategies; 
2) accord between the content of the study materials used in language teaching and learners’ 
interests; 
3) implementation of different forms of active learning (including pair work and group work); 
4) the changed role of teachers from intermediaries of knowledge to partners who guide students in 
the process of acquiring knowledge; and 
5) versatile study materials adjusted and revised based on the goals and needs of learners.",foreign_languages,8.740813,-2.321265
1264,34,"The central idea is that of implementing the principles of active and problem-based learning. To the 
learning activities already used at 1st Stage of Study are added discussions, more attention to developing 
the skills of question-posing, assessment-giving and substantiation. Application of narrative methods 
facilitates values education. Problem-solving tasks, roleplay and analysis of moral dilemmas serve to 
develop the skills of problem-noticing, listening, cooperation and consideration for others. Teachers who 
strive to support the moral development of the students must exhibit sensitivity, attention and discretion. 
In topics about ethics the students become familiarised with classic virtues: their content is revealed in a 
clear manner so that the students understand them and are inspired to develop themselves accordingly. 
Such teaching cannot be reduced to formal moralising. 
When selecting educational materials for the ethics course, the teacher should ensure that they contain: 
1) stories derived from different religious traditions; 

2) stories about certain people whose life and work conformed with important ethical principles and 
these people can thus be presented as role models for the younger generation; and 
3) examples of current movements and organisations that operate in accordance with humanist 
ethical principles and pay attention to and help weaker members of society.
